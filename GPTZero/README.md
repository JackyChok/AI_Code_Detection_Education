# GPTzero AIGC Detector
GPTZero is an AI-generated content detection system developed to identify and analyze artificially generated text, specifically focusing on text produced by AI language models such as GPT-3. This README provides detailed information on how to set up and use the GPTzero AIGC Detector.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you acquired the API key from [GPTZero](https://gptzero.me/):

- `GPTzero_cdm_detect.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook file for running the GLTR AIGC Detector.

In addition to these files, make sure you've updated the paths to the variant folder and AIGC Detector folder for accurate detection.

## Usage

1. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**

   Open the `GPTzero_cdm_detect.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells as per the provided documentation in the file. After running the file, it will call the GPTzero API and generate a CSV file with the detected human-written and AI-generated code results. Ensure that you update the path to the variant folder and confirm that the input variant CSV file is in the correct location within your project directory.

Please make sure to update the relevant paths and file locations as needed.
