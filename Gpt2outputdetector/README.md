# GPT-2 Output Detector
This README provide guidance on how to setup and execute code detection for this AIGC Detector.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following files and dependencies ready in your project directory:

- `cdm_automation.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook file for running the GPT-2 output detector
- `gpt2_output_detector.py`: Configuration file for the GPT-2 output detector
- `Setup`: Folder containing all required files to setup the GPT-2 output detector

In addition to these files, make sure you've updated the paths to the variant folder and AIGC Detector folder.
## Usage
### Setup
The in-depth details on how to setup GPT-2 Output Detector can be found on Setup folder.

### Code Dectection
1. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**

    Open `cdm_automation.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells. This notebook applies the GPT-2 output detector and generates a CSV file containing the detected human-written and AI-generated code results. Be sure to update the path to the variant folder and ensure that the input variant CSV file is located in the correct pathway within your project directory.

Please make sure to update the relevant paths and file locations as needed.
